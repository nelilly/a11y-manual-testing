# a11y-manual-testing
An accessibility resource for manual testing, debugging, and defect remediation. 

This README.md file contains a list of resources to set up a manual testing environment. The [a11y-manual-testing page](https://nelilly.github.io/a11y-manual-testing/) is an HTML file that contains information and links that are useful while testing your sites and features.

> **Automated testing:** Before attempting manual testing the features should be checked using automated tools and any errors corrected.

## Accessibility Testing Suite

Use this resource in conjunction with the series of sites to provide best practices and examples in web accessibility.

- [a11y-manual-testing](https://github.com/nelilly/a11y-manual-testing): an accessibility resource for manual testing, debugging, and defect remediation.
- [a11y-workflow](https://github.com/nelilly/a11y-workflow): an accessibility resource for building manual and automated accessibility testing into a coding workflow.
- [nelilly.github.io/inaccessible-website/](https://nelilly.github.io/inaccessible-website/): an example site providing common accessibility issues to help designers and developers understand how to test for and remediate potential accessibility issues.

## Windows test setup
You should install the following applications for manual testing on Windows:
- [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) for use with Firefox (default browser)
  - [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) extension
  - [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) extension

> It's expedient to bookmark a page with accessibility resources such as [a11y-manual-testing page](https://nelilly.github.io/a11y-manual-testing/). If using a virtual machine environment for testing I've found it handy to set all the browser's home pages to the same link.

## MacOS test setup
MacOS already comes with VoiceOver:
- [VoiceOver](https://help.apple.com/voiceover/mac/10.14/) for use with Safari
  - [a11yTools](http://pauljadam.com/extension.html) extension (Safari)

Consider adding one or more of the following extensions for use in Chrome or Firefox on Mac.
- [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) extension
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) extension
